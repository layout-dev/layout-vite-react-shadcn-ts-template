# Your Layout project

This is codebase for your [Layout app](https://layout.dev/dashboard/projects/$PROJECT_ID).


# Installation

You can always visit your [Layout app](https://layout.dev/dashboard/projects/$PROJECT_ID) and ask the Layout AI agent to handle the updates for you. However, if you'd prefer to update the app manually, follow these steps:

```sh
# 1. Clone the repo.
git clone <$GIT_URL>

# 2. Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# 3. Install the dependencies.
bun install
# You can use `bun install` but need to run `npm install -g bun` to install it first.

# 4. Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
bun run dev
# You can use `bun run dev`

# 5. On your browser navigate to http://localhost:5173/
```
